# ping_tester
One day when I was playing with some online games I noticed that I have 5-15s long laggs every ~2minutes. I quickly wanted to check if the game servers are slow or my ISP (Internet Service Provider) is facing with some difficulties. I checked the internet for a long time period ping tester but I couldn't find any. The best one I've found could ping for a maximum 10 seconds.

That's why I created this short Python script that pings a configurable host and draws an interactive line graph based on the latencies until it is stopped. You can set the host, the number of iterations you would like to see at once and the iteration frequency. The graph looks like:

Happy pinging :)
